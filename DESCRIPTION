Description: Melds genome-wide association tests with structural
    equation modeling (SEM) using 'OpenMx'. This package contains
    low-level C/C++ code to rapidly read genetic data encoded in U.K.
    Biobank or 'plink' formats. Prebuilt modeling options include one and
    two factor models. Alternately, analyses may utilize arbitrary,
    user-provided SEMs.  See Verhulst, Maes, & Neale (2017)
    <doi:10.1007/s10519-017-9842-6> for details. An updated manuscript is
    in preparation.
