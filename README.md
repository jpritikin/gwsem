The goal of gwsem is to provide users with the opportunity to analyze the complex, interconnected array of risk factors, biomarkers, environmental antecedents, comorbid disorders, and other health outcomes on a genome-wide basis using structural equation modeling techniques.

## Installation

GW-SEM utilizes the optimization function of OpenMx.

You can install the released version of OpenMx from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("OpenMx")
```

If you want a new version of OpenMx, you can follow the instruction to build it from source [HERE](https://openmx.ssri.psu.edu).

You can install the released version of gwsem from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("gwsem")
```

GW-SEM is currently under development. Therefore, the CRAN version of the software may not include the latest modifactions, enhancements, or functionality.

If you want to use a development snapshot, clone the source code and do

```
git clone https://github.com/jpritikin/gwsem
cd gwsem
./tools/rox
R CMD INSTALL .
Rscript tools/test.R
```

You cannot use **devtools** `install_github` because it does not run **roxygen2**.
